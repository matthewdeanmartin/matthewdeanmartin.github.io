                        <div>Python<br>I did maintenance development releases of a Python 3 GUI application. The
                            application was for a research study of how people create passwords. The first release
                            needed a few known bugs fixed and demonstrate that no additional bugs were introduced. To
                            achieve this, the legacy application was refactored and put under a large number of
                            automated unit tests.<br><br>Once the legacy application was stabilized, I created a new
                            internal library over the TKInter library to simplify creating new screens. The application
                            was instrumented for diagnostics and trace so that issues could be identified by examining
                            logs.<br><br>The final application included a build script, machine generated API
                            documentation and a packaged application that could run on a machine without a pre-existing
                            Python runtime.<br><br>Tools used PyCharm, Eclipse, Iron Python<br>Libraries used unittest,
                            nose, sphinx, pywin, virtualenv<br><br>.NET Stack Backend Development<br>Created entity
                            framework data tier for authentication store. Augment existing WIF (Windows Identity
                            Framework) single sign on solution to support self configuration. Create HTTP/REST based
                            ASP.NET WebAPI interface and corresponding C#, JavaScript and PHP clients.<br><br>Participated
                            in maintenance of both WebForms, MS-Ajax and MVC 4 applications.<br><br>Created WCF service
                            layer, including features for reducing configuration and misconfiguration risks. Also did
                            WCF performance tuning, which included improving serialization and switching to asynchronous
                            techniques using .NET 4.0 Task library.<br><br>Create data import tool using ASP.NET, jQuery
                            and jQuery-UI to deliver a solution faster and with more quality assurance checks than could
                            have been implemented in WebForms.<br><br>HTML5 and TypeScript Front End Development <br>Implemented
                            requirejs module loading, converted existing JavaScript to TypeScript. Implemented
                            clientside error logging, client side random data generation for testing and underscore
                            based widget templates. Participated in creating knockout-js client side databinding for an
                            MVC application.<br><br>Created workflow for the periodic import of a complex Drupal-based
                            HTML template from an external organization in a way that the same artifacts could be used
                            to style several ASP.NET webforms applications as well as an MVC application.<br><br>DevOps
                            and Buildmastering<br>I established an end-to-end automated TFS build, customized for nUnit
                            tests. Wrote powershell scripts to automate certain build tasks and deployment tasks.

                        <div>OracleForms to .NET Application Conversion.<br>Worked on a large team of three to six
                            developers in an application re-write. We migrated the user interface from Oracle Forms to a
                            hybrid ASP.NET WebForms, MVC and JavaScript driven single page application, with some work
                            to integrate with Oracle backend using PL-SQL. Significant time spent improving web
                            application performance to get the web application which started out with 10-15 second
                            response for most action down to instant response time.<br><br>.NET Performance Tuning.<br>I
                            also did extensive performance for an application that generated Word documents, which at
                            the beginning could run overnight and often failed anyhow. I solved the application’s
                            multi-threading problems, races, deadlocks, implemented Parallel Task Library and WCF
                            patterns to get the reports to generate in three to five minutes, despite having to do 50
                            times the work load.<br><br>DevOps and Buildmastering.<br>Refactored legacy code and
                            implemented automated unit and integration tests to detect breaks before release to
                            test.Participated in the release process using TFS as a process management tool and build
                            server. Saw about six maintenance releases to production and 50 iterative releases to test
                            as a part of a broader continuous integration strategy.

                        <div>Full Stack .NET Development <br>I did maintenance development on a line of business
                            application using C#, TSQL, Javascript, using Telerik components. I upgraded it from .NET
                            1.1 to 3.5. I created a comprehensive set of automated integration and automated unit tests
                            (nUnit) that reduced the number of logged errors from hundreds a day to several per
                            week.<br><br>I was lead developer on a three person team that moved about 15 releases
                            through TSA’s SDLC release process. Task included identifying opportunities for improving
                            the application, architecting the application to allow for collaboration, dividing certain
                            development tasks and code review of other developer’s code. I wrote SDLC documents to
                            support release activities. I also did the maintenance development necessary to get the
                            application to pass C&amp;A (Certification and Authorization).<br><br>DevOps. <br>I set up a
                            complete continuous integration system, initially using Visual Source Safe (VSS), Luntbuild,

                            and TeamCity. I was responsible for managing the servers and workstations on the developer
                            network, including installing operating systems, DBA tasks for MySQL and MS-SQL, such as
                            version upgrades, schema comparison and security hardening.<br><br>.NET Appplication
                            Modernization. <br>I refactored a .NET/C#/LLBGen travel scheduler application to enable the
                            use of a majority of the existing codebase for use by a new department. LLBGen is a ORM,
                            similar to NHibernate. I did another modernization upgrade to take an ASP.NET scheduling and
                            travel application to 2.0 and identified the legacy application’s XSS and SQL Injection

                            Control Migration. <br>I collaborated with administrative staff to repair and stabilize VSS
                            repositories and prevent loss of historical source code. Set up Subversion repository for
                            development team to migrate their source code to.<br><br>Created developer oriented
                            documentation. I wrote data dictionary and API documentation in support of maintenance tasks
                            for MERLIN. I wrote comprehensive web-based user documentation for "MOS Refresh" data
